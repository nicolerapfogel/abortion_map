I would like to expand my work on the abortion dataset used here. I'd like to change the colors around and make it more interactive so you can see what each of the 9 laws are and how it impacts women/people of reproductive capacity in their real lives. Perhaps within the map, a user could xoom into a particularly restrictive state and seeing how people are impacted. I think there's a lot of potential to look at broader problems in a zoomed out map and aggregate data and zooming in on more personal experience.
